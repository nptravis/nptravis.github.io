		<p><p>This is my final blog post as student of Flatiron School! It’s been an incredible journey, learned a ton, and can’t wait for the next step. This will be a presentation of my final portfolio project, a React-Redux app built on top of a rails backend.</p>

		<h2><a href="/the_form_for_helper">The form_for helper</a></h2>
		<p><p>This is a great form building method, one of the many awesome ActionView::Helper objects. Ideal for interfacing with RESTful routes, and nested resources. It will wrap around an instance of a Model object, and give all kinds of useful methods for quickly generating otherwise lengthy HTML, and have all kinds of cool shortcuts since it is directly referencing a model. I will be using pry, a simple ruby gem that bounces into console at a given point. So, first a little setup:</p>

		<p><p>The Ruby CLI gem lab was a bit daunting at first. Create an executable CLI application, turn it into a gem, then… publish? Wait…like other people are going to see my chicken scratch code?? It felt like things were about to get real.</p>

		<h2><a href="/why_i_am_becoming_a_web_developer">Why I am Becoming a Web Developer</a></h2>
		<p><p>It’s pretty simple, I enjoy it. I enjoy the problem solving, the ability to build stuff, and the vibe of the communities that surround it. And coffee…I really enjoy coffee, so that helps.</p>

<p>I worked as a professional musician in NYC for years. Played all over the area, did some touring, and thought to myself, what other skills could I hone during the day and while on the road? So, I started some coding tutorials online, initially HTML, CSS, and then some Javascript, Python, even a bit of C. I started to realize, I actually enjoy doing this. (My story is not that uncommon, a lot of people have found music and coding to utilize similar neurological skills…hmm, next blog post maybe?)</p>

<p>I completed CS50, a free Intro to Computer Science course offered by Harvard, and was hooked, hungry for the next thing. I applied to Flatiron’s Online Web Development Program and was accepted. I have been in the program now for about 2 weeks, as of this post, and am excited for what lies ahead! Thanks for reading!</p>

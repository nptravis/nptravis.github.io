		<h1>Creating a CLI Gem Application</h1>

<p>
	16 Feb 2018  
</p>

<p>The Ruby CLI gem lab was a bit daunting at first. Create an executable CLI application, turn it into a gem, then… publish? Wait…like other people are going to see my chicken scratch code?? It felt like things were about to get real.</p>

<p>I started with this crucial link: <a href="http://bundler.io/v1.12/guides/creating_gem.html">right here</a>. It actually begins so simply (just have to have bundler installed.) To start a gem, just type into your terminal:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>bundle gem my_first_gem
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now get ready for magic time. CD to your newly created folder and check out the goods. It creates an entire file structure for you, with a gemspec file, an rspec file, a license, version control, even a bin console environment! COOL!! Now all you have to do is…write your entire code for your project, no biggie.</p>

<p>I decided to create a app that scrapes LonelyPlanet for the top 10 travel destinations for 2018. I used the Nokogiri gem for the task. I initially had some trouble scraping their site, and learned a crucial lesson, <em>don’t try to scrape elements that are rendered via javascript or react!</em> The elements aren’t loaded until after the scrape is finished, so only returned nil. That only took me about 3 ½ hours of head scratching to figure out. Here is an example of one of my scrape methods:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>def self.scrape
		doc = Nokogiri::HTML(open("https://www.lonelyplanet.com/best-in-travel/countries"))
		
		i = 1
		while i &lt;= 10
			object = self.new
			object.name = doc.css("##{i} h1").text.split(".")[1].strip
			object.description = doc.css("##{i} p").first.text.strip
			object.url = doc.css("##{i} a").attribute('href').value
			@@all &lt;&lt; object
			i+=1
		end
		@@all
	end
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I created Classes for Countries, Cities, Regions, and Best Value destinations. Each Class would create 10 instances, which each had instance variables of a name, and a description. I initially wanted to scrape the entirety of the data as soon as the program loaded, but was taking too long (like 5-10 seconds of just frozen screen) so I decided to scrape the data as the user asked for it, seemed to be a bit smoother UX.</p>

<p>The interface asks the user to choose a category, then a sub category, then returns a description and a link. I used another gem, colorize, to keep the interface color coded, a pretty cool gem for CLI apps. Here is what the CLI looks like, although color won’t come through :(</p>

Canberra, Australia
---------------------------------------
Criminally overlooked Canberra packs a big punch for such a small city. National treasures are found round almost every corner and exciting new boutique precincts have emerged, bulging with gastronomic highlights and cultural must-dos. This is the first year that Canberra will host a Test cricket match at the picturesque Manuka Oval, and later in 2018 the Australian War Memorial will take centre stage as it hosts the 100th anniversary of the WWI Armistice. Significantly, Canberra is establishing a permanent Reconciliation Day into the state’s holiday calendar from 2018 onwards, to symbolise commitment to tolerance between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians.

 Seemed simple enough when I started, but took me about 8 hours, haha. Don’t get me wrong, it was super fun. and really rewarding in the end when everything loaded and worked. I definitely gained a newfound respect for complex applications, and the immense time and effort it takes to create them.

<p>I worked as a professional musician in NYC for years. Played all over the area, did some touring, and thought to myself, what other skills could I hone during the day and while on the road? So, I started some coding tutorials online, initially HTML, CSS, and then some Javascript, Python, even a bit of C. I started to realize, I actually enjoy doing this. (My story is not that uncommon, a lot of people have found music and coding to utilize similar neurological skills…hmm, next blog post maybe?)</p>

<p>I completed CS50, a free Intro to Computer Science course offered by Harvard, and was hooked, hungry for the next thing. I applied to Flatiron’s Online Web Development Program and was accepted. I have been in the program now for about 2 weeks, as of this post, and am excited for what lies ahead! Thanks for reading!</p>
